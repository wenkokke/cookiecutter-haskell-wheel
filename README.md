**NOTE**: This project is no longer maintained, as it's proven more useful to use the [example-haskell-wheel] repository itself as a template. The reason is that by explicitly starting from [example-haskell-wheel] and being somewhat careful with your commits, it becomes very easy pull in changes from the template.
